# Melanoma Skin cancer detection 
> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
The solution provided in the ipynb file divided into - Data understanding, cleaning, prepartion and model building.


## Conclusions

- The code did get rid of overfititng and the class rebalancing helped in fitting the data properly. 
- Few approaches were tried and ultimately batch normalization & augmentation helped.


## Technologies Used
- Python and libraries necessary to build Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso regressions
- Git
